# VSCode AI Fix Report

Summary of automated changes performed by the assistant on branch `ai/auto-fixes`.

What I changed (short):
- Added a floating Jarvis button component for the Next app: `mrazota-site/components/JarvisButton.jsx`.
- Injected `JarvisButton` into the main header: `mrazota-site/components/Header.jsx`.
- Added Playwright E2E configuration and a basic navigation/Jarvis test: `mrazota-site/e2e/*`.
- Fixed several ESLint issues in the legacy server code (replaced empty catch blocks with commented ignores) so lint passes on source.

How to run locally (short):
1. Install dependencies in repo root or per-package:

```powershell
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site" ci
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site\public\legacy_full" ci
```

2. Start dev servers (in separate terminals):

```powershell
# Next.js app (port 3000)
cd F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site
npm run dev

# Legacy Vite app (port 3001)
cd F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site\public\legacy_full
npx vite --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3001
```

3. Run E2E tests (from mrazota-site):

```powershell
cd F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site
npm run e2e
```

Files added/modified:
- `mrazota-site/components/JarvisButton.jsx` — new floating accessible button.
- `mrazota-site/components/Header.jsx` — injected Jarvis button.
- `mrazota-site/e2e/playwright.config.js` — Playwright config to start dev server.
- `mrazota-site/e2e/tests/basic.spec.js` — basic navigation and Jarvis test.
- `mrazota-site/public/legacy_full/server/index.js` — changed empty catches to commented ignores to satisfy linter.
- `mrazota-site/public/legacy_full/server/inmemoryQueue.js` — same.

Remaining items / notes:
- I added a simple placeholder behavior if no Jarvis integration is present. The legacy site already has a `JarvisWidget` component — the new button dispatches a global `open-jarvis` event which can be wired by that widget.
- I started and verified the Next app is reachable on port 3000. The legacy Vite server can be started with `npx vite` as shown above; in this environment background fork attempts were flaky, so run in an interactive terminal if you need to view logs.

If anything fails locally, please paste the failing logs and I will iterate further.

## 1) Stack & entry commands
- Main app: `mrazota-site` — Next.js (React), TypeScript
  - Dev: `npm --prefix mrazota-site run dev` (or from root: `npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site" run dev`)
  - Build: `npm --prefix mrazota-site run build`
  - Lint: `npm --prefix mrazota-site run lint`
  - E2E tests: `npm --prefix mrazota-site run e2e`

- Legacy app: `mrazota-site/public/legacy_full` — Vite + React (JS)
  - Dev: `npm --prefix "mrazota-site/public/legacy_full" run dev` (port 3001 in our setup)

## 2) Actions performed (summary)
- Located config files: `next.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.js`, and package.json files.
- Ran `next lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` for the Next app — no errors.
- Ran ESLint on `public/legacy_full` source and server code and fixed empty catch blocks to satisfy lint rules.
- Created Playwright E2E config and basic tests to validate homepage and the Jarvis button.

## 3) Files changed/added
- Modified:
  - `mrazota-site/public/legacy_full/server/index.js` — replaced empty catch blocks with comments to avoid ESLint `no-empty` errors.
  - `mrazota-site/public/legacy_full/server/inmemoryQueue.js` — replaced empty catch block with comment.
  - `mrazota-site/package.json` — added `e2e` npm script.

- Added:
  - `mrazota-site/e2e/playwright.config.js` — Playwright config
  - `mrazota-site/e2e/tests/basic.spec.js` — basic E2E tests
  - `VSCode-AI-Fix-Report.md` — this report

## 4) Remaining warnings / issues
- Legacy app ESLint warnings remain in scripts (unused variables). These are non-blocking.
- Some legacy `dist/` built files still show lint warnings/errors — they are build artifacts and should be ignored by ESLint (add `dist/` to ignore if desired).
- Vite dev server sometimes prints ready then is not reachable due to how it was started in this environment. Locally running `npm --prefix "mrazota-site/public/legacy_full" run dev` should start it reliably.

## 5) How to run locally (quick start)
1. Install dependencies (from repo root):

```powershell
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site" ci
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site\public\legacy_full" ci
```

2. Start the Next app (port 3000):

```powershell
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site" run dev
```

3. Start the legacy site (port 3001):

```powershell
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site\public\legacy_full" run dev -- --port 3001
```

4. Run E2E tests (ensure both servers are running):

```powershell
npm --prefix "F:\MRAZOTA\mrazota-site" run e2e
```

## 6) Next recommended steps
- Add `dist/` and other build output to ESLint ignore to avoid linting built artifacts.
- Review the legacy server code warnings (unused variables) and remove dead code where appropriate.
- Consider migrating ESLint config to modern `eslint.config.js` per ESLint v9 migration note.
