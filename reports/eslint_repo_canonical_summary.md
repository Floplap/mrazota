ESLint canonical AFTER summary

Date: 2025-10-26
Branch: fix/mass-fix-20251026-193537

Overview
- This file records the canonical *after* ESLint status after running package-local linters and applying auto-fixes where safe.

Per-package results (authoritative):
- frontend: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- mrazota-site (Next.js): 0 errors, 0 warnings (next lint)
- backend: 0 errors, 0 warnings

Total (aggregated): 0 errors, 0 warnings

Context:
- Earlier repo-wide runs reported large numbers (â‰ˆ281 errors etc.) because ESLint scanned generated/build artifacts and Next.js-generated files which caused parsing failures. Those are not actionable source issues.
- The recommended canonical check is to run package-local linters: `cd frontend && npx eslint src --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx`, `cd mrazota-site && npm run lint`, `cd backend && npx eslint . --ext .js,.ts`.

If you want me to force the repo-wide ESLint to never include generated files in CI, I can:
- add a small helper script to run per-package linters and fail CI only on those results, or
- convert the root ESLint config to explicitly use the `ignores` entries (already present) and remove older `.eslintignore` usage.

Next steps I can take now (pick one):
- Run builds/tests (tsc, next build, frontend build, vitest) and report results.
- Remove intermediate debug JSON/log files or move them to `reports/`.
- Push the WIP branch and open a PR (requires remote auth).
