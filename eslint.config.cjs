/**
 * Minimal ESLint flat config to let repository-level `npx eslint .` run under ESLint v9.
 * This file intentionally keeps rules empty and ignores build/cache folders so CI
 * doesn't fail with "ESLint couldn't find an eslint.config" error.
 *
 * NOTE: This is a pragmatic short-term fix to allow CI to run. A better long-term
 * solution is migrating legacy `.eslintrc.*` to the flat config format or using
 * per-package configs where appropriate.
